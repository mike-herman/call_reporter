# call_reporter_duckdb_superset
---

This is a simple project using [dbt-duckdb](https://github.com/duckdb/dbt-duckdb) and [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) to build an all-in-one Modern Data Stack which can be used on your laptop without Cloud Stacks.

It's inspired by this article: [Modern Data Stack in a Box with DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/2022/10/12/modern-data-stack-in-a-box.html).
The specific configuration for implementation is as follows.
This time, the focus is on simplification, and parts such as `ORCHESTRATION` and `INGESTION` are omitted.
Considering the developer productivity in a local environment, `ORCHESTRATION` is unnecessary,
and for `INGESTION`, DuckDB's httpfs or scanner extension is considered sufficient.
Of course, it is possible to expand as necessary.
